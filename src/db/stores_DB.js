						It feels like the kind of place worth visiting every day.
						Featuring dark mahogany wood and comfortable seating for
						35 people this place has it all. From incredible pour-overs
						to coffees with a scoop of ice cream, coffee addicts will want for nothing here.`

		desc: `Philadelphia boasts terrific interpretations of Neapolitan,
		New York and nowhere-in-particular pizzas but it’s the local bakers,
		old-school and new, that make it a one-of-a-kind pizza city. Two South
		Philly joints, Lorenzo and Sons and Santucci’s, adhere to local traditions,
		whereas the revered Joe Beddia imposes his own rules—both on his pizza and
		on the people who line up for it—at Pizzeria Beddia. Also worth a visit:
		Nomad Pizza Company (pictured), where wood-fired brick-oven pizza is served
		up using local produce.`
