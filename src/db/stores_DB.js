		desc: `Philadelphia boasts terrific interpretations of Neapolitan,
		New York and nowhere-in-particular pizzas but it’s the local bakers,
		old-school and new, that make it a one-of-a-kind pizza city. Two South
		Philly joints, Lorenzo and Sons and Santucci’s, adhere to local traditions,
		whereas the revered Joe Beddia imposes his own rules—both on his pizza and
		on the people who line up for it—at Pizzeria Beddia. Also worth a visit:
		Nomad Pizza Company (pictured), where wood-fired brick-oven pizza is served
		up using local produce.`

		desc: `KFC was one of the first American fast food chains to expand internationally,
		opening outlets in Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. 
		Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, it experienced mixed fortunes domestically, as it went 
		through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the 
		restaurant business. In the early 1970s, KFC was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein,
		which was taken over by the R.J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate; that company sold 
		the chain to PepsiCo. The chain continued to expand overseas, however, and in 1987, 
		it became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China. It has since expanded 
		rapidly in China, which is now the company's single largest market. PepsiCo spun off 
		its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to Yum! Brands.`
